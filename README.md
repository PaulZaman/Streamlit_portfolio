# üöó Road Safety & Uber Data Insights - Streamlit Project

Welcome to my **Streamlit project**, which is divided into three sections: a portfolio presentation, an exploration of **Uber data analysis**, and an investigation into **how to avoid road accidents in France**. This project is built using **Streamlit** and provides interactive visualizations and insights on various topics.

## Overview

This project explores **three main areas**:

1. **Portfolio**: A personal section that introduces myself, my skills, and my projects.
   
2. **Uber Data Analysis**: A data-driven analysis of Uber trips, focusing on how drivers can maximize their earnings based on various factors such as time of day, location, and trip frequency.
   
3. **How to Avoid Road Accidents in France**: An analysis based on real accident data in France, with insights on road safety tips, high-risk periods, and geographical areas. The goal is to provide data-backed recommendations for reducing accidents.

## Project Structure

1. **Portfolio**: 
    - A dedicated section that showcases my profile, experience, and other professional projects.
    - Introduces viewers to my background, technical skills, and current work.

2. **Uber Data Analysis**: 
    - **Objective**: To analyze Uber trip data and extract useful patterns for drivers to **maximize their earnings**.
    - **Key Features**:
      - Visualizations of Uber trip statistics (time, location, fare).
      - Insights into the most profitable times and locations for Uber drivers.
      - Data-driven suggestions to help drivers optimize their trips and earnings.

3. **How to Avoid Road Accidents in France**: 
    - **Objective**: To analyze historical accident data in France and derive insights on how to avoid accidents.
    - **Key Features**:
      - Accident statistics by location (department), time, weather conditions, and trip purpose.
      - Data-driven analysis to identify high-risk areas and periods.
      - Recommendations for improving road safety based on these insights.

## Features

- **Interactive Dashboards**: 
   - Each section is interactive, allowing users to navigate through data visualizations easily and explore different insights.

- **Customizable Inputs**:
   - The **accident analysis** and **Uber data analysis** sections allow users to modify input parameters (e.g., time of day, location) to generate personalized results.

- **Clear Visualizations**:
   - The project leverages **Plotly** to create engaging and dynamic plots, providing visual insights into Uber trip trends and accident patterns.
